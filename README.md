Synopsis

The purpose of this challenge was to use SciKitLearn library to
scale given data. Cluster given data using K-Means using full data set.
Then repeat using principal component analysis(PCA) with n=3. We then compare
the two visually to examine impact of PCA vs using full data set.

Results

In this instance using PCA gave similar performance to using
full data set.
